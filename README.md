# Train-Scheduler

Web app that incorporates Firebase to host and display train arrival and departure data

## Project Motivation

This app was developed as part of the Firebase homework assignment at the University of Toronto Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. This project is a testament to the mastery of advanced JavaScript and jQuery concepts as well as a real time Firebase database to persist information entered into the app by the user.

## Getting Started

Either download the zipped project from GitHub or clone the repo into your local machine and open index.html using a browser. When the page loads up, enjoy!
